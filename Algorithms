operator (+)


Class Definition:
   - Define a class `BigReal` with private members:
     - `sign` (a character, '+' or '-') to represent the sign of the number.
     - `integer` (a string) to store the integer part of the number.
     - `fraction` (a string) to store the fractional part of the number.

Constructors:
   - Define two constructors:
     - Default constructor: Initializes the object with a default value of 0.
     - Parameterized constructor: Accepts a string representation of a real number and extracts the sign, integer, and fractional parts.

Overloaded Operator:
     - `+` (addition): Perform addition of two `BigReal` objects.



 Implementation:
   - The addition operator `+` is defined as a member function for the `BigReal` class.
   - Initialize a `BigReal` object `result` to store the result of the addition.
   - Extract the signs, integers, and fractional parts of both operands.
   - Make sure the integer parts have the same length by adding leading zeros if needed.
   - Initialize a carry variable to handle carry during addition.
   - Iterate through the digits of both integer parts from right to left, add corresponding digits along with any carry, and update the result's integer part.
   - If there is a carry after the loop, add it to the result.
   - Set the sign of the result based on the signs of the operands.
   - Return the result.

Main Function:
   - Create two `BigReal` objects `a` and `b` with the given real numbers.
   - Add `a` and `b` to calculate the result.
   - Print the result to the standard output.
